## Process of Creating the Dashboard  

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**  
- **Source of Data**: The data was obtained from the HRAnalytics.csv and loaded into Microsoft Power BI.  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.  
  - Addressed missing or inconsistent entries by imputing values or removing invalid rows.  
  - Standardized columns such as job roles, salary brackets, and education levels for uniformity.  

### **Step 2: Data Transformation and Modeling**  
- Utilized **Power Query** to transform the data:  
  - Grouped and filtered data to focus on key dimensions like age, education, job role, and salary.  
  - Created a calculated measure for **Attrition Rate** in PowerPivot:  
    \[
    \text{Attrition Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Employees Left}}{\text{Total Number of Employees}} \times 100
    \]  

### **Step 3: Designing the Dashboard**  
- Selected appropriate visualizations to represent key dimensions and metrics.  
- Organized the layout for clarity:  
  - Placed KPIs (e.g., employee count, attrition rate) at the top for quick insights.  
  - Used intuitive visual formats (e.g., pie charts, bar charts) to ensure readability.

## Breakdown of Charts and Their Purpose  

### **1. Attrition by Education (Pie Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Displays the distribution of attrition based on employees' educational backgrounds.  
- **Why Used**: Pie charts effectively showcase proportions and highlight differences among categories.  
- **Insight**:  
  - Minimal attrition in Marketing and Technical Degrees suggests strong retention in these fields.  
  - Attrition in Life Sciences (2%) could require additional investigation.  

---

### **2. Attrition by Salary (Bar Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Breaks down attrition by salary brackets to understand how compensation influences turnover.  
- **Why Used**: Bar charts provide a clear view of categorical comparisons like salary ranges.  
- **Insight**:  
  - High attrition for employees earning less than $5K indicates a need to revisit compensation policies for lower brackets.  

---

### **3. Attrition by Age (Bar Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Examines the age distribution of employees leaving the organization.  
- **Why Used**: Bar charts clearly show attrition counts for discrete age groups.  
- **Insight**:  
  - Attrition peaks in the **26â€“35 age group**, possibly due to career growth opportunities outside the company.  

---

### **4. Attrition by Years of Experience (YOE) at Company (Line Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Analyzes attrition trends based on tenure in the company.  
- **Why Used**: Line charts effectively highlight trends over time or sequential data points like years of experience.  
- **Insight**:  
  - Spikes in attrition for employees with less than **5 years of experience** underscore the need to improve engagement strategies for new hires.  

---

### **5. Attrition by Job Role (Bar Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Highlights attrition trends across different job roles.  
- **Why Used**: Bar charts are effective for comparing counts across categories like job roles.  
- **Insight**:  
  - **Laboratory Technicians** and **Sales Executives** exhibit higher attrition rates, suggesting job-specific challenges like workload or job satisfaction.  

---

### **6. Attrition by Gender (Stacked Bar Chart)**  
- **Purpose**: Provides a comparison of attrition rates between male and female employees.  
- **Why Used**: Stacked bar charts effectively compare two subcategories (male vs. female) within a broader category (attrition).  
- **Insight**:  
  - Minimal gender difference in attrition indicates no significant gender bias.  

---

### **Summary Metrics**  
The KPIs displayed at the top of the dashboard provide a quick summary of workforce metrics:  
- **Total Employee Count**: 47 employees included in the analysis.  
- **Total Attrition**: 8 employees left the organization.  
- **Attrition Rate**: 17%, calculated as a dynamic measure in PowerPivot.  
- **Average Employee Age**: 58 years.  
- **Average Salary**: $9.2K.  
- **Average Tenure**: 8.5 years at the company.  

These metrics give an at-a-glance view of the organization's overall workforce health.
